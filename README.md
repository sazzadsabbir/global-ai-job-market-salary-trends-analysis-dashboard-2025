# Introduction
This project analyzes the 2025 AI Job Market using a Kaggle dataset and presents insights through an interactive Excel dashboard combined with focused data analysis. The objective is to understand how AI job opportunities differ across countries, job roles, job types, and industries. 
Users can filter the dashboard by job title, country, and job type, while key KPIs such as median salary, job count, and top hiring industry update dynamically. Beyond visualization, the project highlights salary–demand trade-offs, industry dominance, and geographic concentration in the AI job market.
